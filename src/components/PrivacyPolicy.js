          5A. Facebook & Instagram Integration
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          myHandle allows creators and businesses to connect their <strong>Instagram Business or Creator accounts</strong> (and linked Facebook Pages)
          to access features such as analytics, post publishing, and direct message management.
          This connection uses Meta’s official <strong>Facebook Login</strong>, <strong>Instagram Graph API</strong>, and <strong>Pages API</strong>.
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          When you connect your Instagram account through Facebook Login, we receive an authentication token and limited data as permitted by the
          permissions (scopes) you approve in the consent screen. We request only the minimum scopes needed to provide the features you use:
        </Typography>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>public_profile</strong> – to identify you during Facebook Login and associate the connection with your myHandle account.</li>
          <li><strong>instagram_basic</strong> – access to your Instagram username, profile picture, followers count, and media count (for your connected account).</li>
          <li><strong>pages_show_list</strong> – to show the Facebook Pages you manage and discover the Instagram account linked to each Page.</li>
          <li><strong>business_management</strong> – used in limited cases to verify and manage the relationship between your Business assets and our app
              (e.g., linking eligible assets, assigning permissions within your Business if you choose to enable advanced features). We do not use this scope
              to modify your content or advertise on your behalf.</li>
          <li><strong>instagram_content_publish</strong> (optional; when you enable publishing) – to allow you to publish or schedule posts to your Instagram account.</li>
          <li><strong>instagram_manage_messages</strong> and <strong>pages_messaging</strong> (optional; when you enable inbox) – to help you view and respond to DMs
              initiated by your audience, in accordance with Meta’s messaging policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          We use these permissions <strong>only</strong> to provide the features you explicitly use. We do not read, store, or share your private messages,
          photos, or content beyond what is necessary to display insights or manage publishing on your behalf. Access tokens are stored securely and encrypted
          on our servers with strict access controls.
